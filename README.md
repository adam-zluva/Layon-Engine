# Layon Engine

A simple game engine I'm making for educational purposed using the SDL2 library. Not in active development - only when I'm bored in my free time :)
Feel free to use it however you want.

## Dependencies
- libsdl2-dev
- libsdl2-image-dev

## Compilation

Once all dependencies are installed, all you have to do is to run:
```shell
make
```
If the compilation is successful, you should see `main.bin` executable file appear in the directory. Compilation also populates the `obj` directory with a bunch of object files `*.o`. They are what makes out the executable file and are only necessary for compilation - no need to worry about them.
